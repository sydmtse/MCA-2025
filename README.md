**task 2:Theme of My Dataset:**
- 1930s Shanghai Jazz

**task 3:Challenges to music data**
- Challenges like access really speak from my expereince. In today's age, streaming services are the savviest way of accessing data, but these are barriered by pay-walls. I, myself, have Spotify Music on a family-plan with friends because this was the most cost-effective way of getting access to the music we wanted and avoiding adverts.
- I'm not sure my theme has been fully realized or amalgamates to Spotify accessibility, but I think having chosen a theme that is from the 1930s when music access would have been limited to public spaces, or via records.
- Today, 1930s jazz music data has been recaptured into digitized formats that give greater access but also preservation of a past era of music.
