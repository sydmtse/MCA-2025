# Top Hits of '93

## **Task 1: Theme of Dataset**
The theme of my dataset are the Top Hits of the year 1993. 1993 has often been cited as one of the golden years of music, due to the peak of alternative rock, major hip-hop debuts, and the continued success of R&B. The dataset will encompasses the most commercially successful and culturally influnetial songs from the year. I chose this theme as some of my favourite songs and many songs that would be considered all-time classics like Linger by the Cranberries, I'm Every Woman by Whitney Houston, or Mr.Jones by Counting Crows were all conceived in this year. It is truly an iconic year for music, and as my dataset theme it gives me more freedom of range for genre and artists I get to include. 

## **Task 2: Challenges and Manifestions of My Music Data**
### Challenges
Based on my experience, one of the main challenges in working with music and music-related data is access. Today, streaming services are savviest and most data-rich platforms, yet much of their content is locked behind paywalls - with free options being inconvenienced by interrupted listening experiences, or restricted by regional availability. I personally use Spotify, which provides extensive metadata and listening analytics, but its data is not openly accessible for download. Copyright restrictions further complicate this issue, as most commercially released music cannot be freely shared, limiting the ability to study or archive audio recordings. Another challenge lies in the fragmented nature of data sources - different platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Billboard Charts, and fan-curated sites use varying metadata standards, meaning key metadata are often inconsistent across databases. This is especially true for my theme as the year encompasses multiple artists/composers and genres that will need to be accounted for. Finally, issues of curation and representation prevailed in this time: while music in 1993 was globally diverse, major charts archives tended to prioritize Western, English-language hits, overlooking non-English or regional successes.

### Current Manifestations
**Descriptive** 
Data relating to the Top Hits of 1993 currently exist across several digitial platforms, each curating and presenting it in different ways. Streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music collect and organize data based on popularity metrics, user engagement, and algorithmic categorization. They provide metadata like artist, album, release date, genre, label, and chart performance. The focus is largely commercial, with an emphasis on visibility, rankings, and streaming statistics (or “listeners” as used on Spotify). Community-driven sites like MusicBrainz provide more detailed metadata, including production credits and catalogue numbers. However, it will be important to ensure consistency across these different platforms. 
**Notated**
Music scores or transcriptions are less widely available for popular music or hit music due to ongoing copyright restrictions. Official sheet music exists through licensed publishers, often limited by paywalls or proprietary formats. Some publicly available transcriptions and MIDI files can be found on community platforms like MuseScore and due to the popularity of these tracks many songs are used for educational means (free to use beginner sheet music). 

**Acoustic**
Referring to audio recordings themselves , is widely attainable through streaming services - like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube - but tightly controlled by copyright holders. There are also channels that with accompanying technical metadata - tempo, loudness, energy, and key - derived through audio analysis tools. Researchers can access these acoustic features via APIs for computational study. However, while acoustic data for the *Top Hits of 1993* is plentiful in commercial contexts, it remains constrained in accessibility and long-term preservation. But there are multiple avenues in addition to the band's official channel but also live concert recordings, lyric videos, and fan covers.
