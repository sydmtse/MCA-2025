   <p>In this week's task, I transcribed Linger by The Cranberries. Orignially this arrangement was for synthesizer and piano, but I transposed it to voice and piano instead. Whilst transforming the score there were multiple problems I faced:</p>
   <ul>
  <li>Added an extra bar of measures at the beginning of the original score, I was unable to remove these without deleting the seconnd bar of measures as well.</li>
  <li>Changed fret board diagrams which turned the single notes with slurs into a barré, I changes this back but was unable to add the slur notation on top.</li>
  <li>Minor notations were added such as a double cleff and count numbers above measures - these were deleted</li>
  <li>The final measure's lyrics were altered and needed to be fixed.</li>
  </ul>
