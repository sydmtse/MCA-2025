   <h2>Task 1: MEI file with Updated Metadata</h2>
   <p>This week, I incorporated two new elements into the metadata: genre classification and licensing information. Following the MEI Guidelines, I attempted to add the genre Alternative Rock, which was highlighted as a highly popular genre within my theme of 1993 Top Hits. Although the MEI Friend did not initially recognize the term, I intended to place it within a < noteStmt > element.</p>
   <p>In terms of licensing, I included © Warner-Tamerlane Publishing Corp. as this is the copyright control of the song’s music and lyrics, within the < availability > element. However, I also included a source reference and added a note “for educational use only” to clarify the encoded material is being used under the fair-use policy that protects artist’s property whilst also making it accessible for educational uses.</p>

   <h2>Task 2: Render revised MEI metadata</h2>

    <img src="meiscreenshot.png" class="meiscreenshot">

    <p>One way I would format my metadata is by presenting it in a table. In this layout, the left column will contain the metadata element (such as title, artist, publisher), and the right column displays a corresponding value. A tabular format offers a clear visual distinction between data types and their information, making the relationships easy to understand at a glance. It also improves readability by organizing the metadata in a structured, consistent manner, which delivers detials quickly without confusion.</p>
