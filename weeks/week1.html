   <h2>Task 1: Dataset Theme</h2>
      <p>My theme is Hits from 1993 as it is often accredited as the golden year in modern music. 1993 marked an intersection of genres - alternative rock dominated the mainstream with bands like Nirvana and Radiohead, hip-hop and R&B made groundbreaking strides with artists such as Snoop Dogg and Janet Jackson, and a new wave of influential female musicians, including Björk and Toni Braxton, began reshaping the sound and image of pop culture. The diversity and experimentation of 1993’s music scene make it a standout year that continues to influence artists and audiences today.</p>

   <h2>Task 2: Challenges & Manifestations</h2>
   <h2>Challenges</h2>
   <p>Based on my experience, one of the main challenges in working with music and music-related data is access. Today, streaming services are savviest and most data-rich platforms, yet much of their content is locked behind paywalls - with free options being inconvenienced by interrupted listening experiences, or restricted by regional availability. I personally use Spotify, which provides extensive metadata and listening analytics, but its data is not openly accessible for download. Copyright restrictions further complicate this issue, as most commercially released music cannot be freely shared, limiting the ability to study or archive audio recordings. Another challenge lies in the fragmented nature of data sources - different platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Billboard Charts, and fan-curated sites use varying metadata standards, meaning key metadata are often inconsistent across databases. This is especially true for my theme as the year encompasses multiple artists/composers and genres that will need to be accounted for. Finally, issues of curation and representation prevailed in this time: while music in 1993 was globally diverse, major charts archives tended to prioritize Western, English-language hits, overlooking non-English or regional successes.</p>
  <h2>Current Manifestion</h2>  
  <h3>Descriptive</h3>
  <p>Data relating to the Top Hits of 1993 currently exist across several digital platforms, each curating and presenting it in different ways. Streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music collect and organize data based on popularity metrics, user engagement, and algorithmic categorization. They provide metadata like artist, album, release date, genre, label, and chart performance. The focus is largely commercial, with an emphasis on visibility, rankings, and streaming statistics (or “listeners” as used on Spotify). Community-driven sites like MusicBrainz provide more detailed metadata, including production credits and catalogue numbers. However, it will be important to ensure consistency across these different platforms. </p>
  <h3>Notated</h3>
  <p>Music scores or transcriptions are less widely available for popular music or hit music due to ongoing copyright restrictions. Official sheet music exists through licensed publishers, often limited by paywalls or proprietary formats. Some publicly available transcriptions and MIDI files can be found on community platforms like MuseScore and due to the popularity of these tracks many songs are used for educational means (free to use beginner sheet music).</p>
  <h3>Acoustic</h3>
  <p>Referring to audio recordings themselves, is widely attainable through streaming services - like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube - but tightly controlled by copyright holders. There are also channels that with accompanying technical metadata - tempo, loudness, energy, and key - derived through audio analysis tools. Researchers can access these acoustic features via APIs for computational study. However, because full audio files are restricted and formats are proprietary, the ability to conduct open, reproducible analysis is limited. Thus, while acoustic data for the Top Hits of 1993 is plentiful in commercial contexts, it remains constrained in accessibility and long-term preservation.</p>
