   <h2>Task 1: Dataset Theme</h2>
   <p>My dataset is themed around the Top Hits of 1993. This year is often credited as a ‘golden era’ for music due to the popularization of intersecting genres, ushering in a year of experimentation that echoes in modern music. 1993 is characterized for the mainstream success of alternative rock music, hallmark hip hop and R&B releases and the prominence of female artist success across the charts. Iconic album releases from bands such as Smashing Pumpkin, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam achieved great success, along with influential debuts from the Wu-Tang Clan’s Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and RadioHead’s Pablo Honey album.

   <h2>Task 2: Challenges & Manifestations</h2>
   <h2>Challenges</h2>
   <p>Based on my experience, one of the main challenges in working with music and music-related data is access. Today, streaming services are savviest and most data-rich platforms, yet much of their content is locked behind paywalls - with free options being inconvenienced by interrupted listening experiences, or restricted by regional availability. I personally use Spotify, which provides extensive metadata and listening analytics, but its data is not openly accessible for download. Copyright restrictions further complicate this issue, as most commercially released music cannot be freely shared, limiting the ability to study or archive audio recordings. Another challenge lies in the fragmented nature of data sources - different platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Billboard Charts, and fan-curated sites use varying metadata standards, meaning key metadata are often inconsistent across databases. This is especially true for my theme as the year encompasses multiple artists/composers and genres that will need to be accounted for. Finally, issues of curation and representation prevailed in this time: while music in 1993 was globally diverse, major charts archives tended to prioritize Western, English-language hits, overlooking non-English or regional successes.</p>
  <h2>Current Manifestion</h2>  
  <h3>Descriptive</h3>
  <p>Given the umbrella of genres, artists, and songs that the theme, Top Hits of ‘93, covers there is a wide breadth of sources to recover descriptive data from. When the music from this year was originally released, it was distributed primarily through the popular formats of the time — chiefly physical sales of CDs and vinyl records. Today, the best source for all songs from this era can be found via streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and more. Here, data is organized by artists and their discography (albums). Additionally, platforms like Spotify curate artist’s most listened to tracks into “This Is” folder (an essential playlist) whereby tracks can be added to personalized playlists. Streaming services also utilize algorithmic tracking software to market “new music” and “your discover weekly” lists tailored to users' tastes. This catering is made possible with descriptive data that leaves an identifiable marker on pieces so it may then be organized, compared, and recommended to users. This data is not visible to users, instead it amalgamates via song title, artist, album title, duration of the song, genre, year, contributors (composer, lyricists, etc), file information (types, size, etc), and more. 
</p>
  <h3>Notated</h3>
  <p>Notated music can be found in the form of sheet music through online resources and catalogues. The songs of 1993, in particular, have become something of rock and R&B classics that are popular and commonly sought among musicians and amateurs alike. In addition to providing accessible sheet music, notated music can be filtered by artist, album, scoring, and manipulated for specific instrument playing. 
</p>
  <h3>Acoustic</h3>
  <p>Aforementioned, acoustic music can also be found on all major streaming services and additionally on public domains like YouTube, where users can watch both official and fan-made video and audio files of live performances, lyrical videos, and covers of songs.
