    <h2>Task 1: Extract Features</h2>
    <p>For this task, I further analysis the 3 tracks selected from Week 8.</p>
    <p>The following images depicts:</p>

            <li>Spectrogram</li>
            <li>Chromagram</li>
            <li>MeI Frequency Cepstral Coeffients</li>

   <h2>Task 2: Compute and visualize features with histograms</h2>
   <p>Using Python's Jupyter Notebook, I computed and visualized the histograms for the MFCC feature of each of my 3 tracks:</p>
   <h3 class="subtitle">Track 1: Fade Into You</h3>
  <img src="../mazzy2.png" alt="Mazzy MFCC graph" class="analysis-img">   
   <h3 class="subtitle">Track 2: Mr. Jones</h3>
  <img src="../crows2.png" alt="Crows MFCC graph" class="analysis-img">   
  <h3 class="subtitle">Track 3: Cryin'</h3>
  <img src="../aero2.png" alt="Aero MFCC graph" class="analysis-img">  
<h3>Comparison of Histograms</h3>
<p>For this analysis, I compared the MFCC histograms for the three tracks in my theme: Fade Into You, Mr.Jones, and Cryin’. Given availability of tracks within my theme, these three are similar in that they all converge the Alternative Rock genre. As expected, Mr.Jones and Cryin’ show the strongest similarity across many of the MFCCs. Their mid-range coefficients (for example MFCCs 5-10) show nearly identical bell-shaped distributions with comparable spread and central tendency. This makes sense given that both tracks veer closer to Rock for their more intense sounds. Meanwhile, Fade Into You, is much dreamier and steers towards Pop. This is seen in MFCCs 1-3 where it has a more extreme negative range and sharper peak compared to the other tracks.</p>
